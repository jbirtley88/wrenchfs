Nuclear Launch Codes

Dear Submarine Captain,

In the event of HM Government being wiped out in a nuclear strike, unload your entire payload of warheads on co-ordinates 53.30084331454815, -2.4022493728218612.

This is the Northbound services on the M6 at Knutsford.  They clamped my car and charged me œ100 to release it.

Love and kisses,




The Prime Minister
